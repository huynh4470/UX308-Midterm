Fashion is a great way to express oneself. Painting on your clothes can add an expressive feeling. Acrylic paints are great because it doesn't come off in the wash and is easy to use. Layers of paint can be piled on top of each other to create cool effects. Tip: It is best to paint on non-stretchy material.  Happy painting!
