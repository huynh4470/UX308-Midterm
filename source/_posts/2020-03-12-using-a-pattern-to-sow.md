_A great_ _way to get a unique shirt that no one else has is to sow your own_. You can pick your own colour, and texture. However, following a pattern is important to make sure that you get the correct measurements. A pattern can be very helpful especially for beginners as they are easy to follow. Patterns can be bought at any fabric store such as Lens Mills or Fabricland. So you can just buy the pattern at the same time you buy the fabric. Have fun sowing!
